# Hello, MDX

This is a sample post written in MDX. You can use GitHub-flavored markdown features like tables and task lists:

- [x] MDX rendering
- [ ] Draft another post

## Links and headings

Headings get slugs and autolink anchors.

```ts
export const greet = (name: string) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

> Tip: Put your posts in `src/content` as `.mdx` files.
